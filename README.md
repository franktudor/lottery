Lottery
=======

A Country and State Lottery Number Generator developed in Python.

The concept of the lottery is a fun one.  Everyone would like to win a jackpot which would potentially solve all kinds of financial problems/constraints/limitations. However the fact is, each ticket is like buying a dream, and rarely if never plays out.

The object is to give a good random selection of lottery numbers. 

There is no weighting towards number frequency (which could make for an interesting addition later).

Although this won't scale, it is a good start.  It needs more states/lottery options. That means there will need to be a few additional files to break out of this one page program. It will possibly need another option selector added for state, maybe a fourth, for country if it gets that big.

I should set mega-millions and powerball the first options by default since most all U.S. states participate in those.

The option menu chain should go like this: country->state->lottery
- Country Selector
- State (province) Selector
- Lottery Type Selector
